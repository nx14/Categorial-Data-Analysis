Dataset: zipcode  contains normalized handwritten digits in 16 Ã— 16 grayscale images. The digits were origi- nally scanned from envelopes by the U.S. Postal Service and have been deslanted and size normalized. The predictor space is of dimension p = 256 + 1 (including the intercept term). There are 7291 training observations and 2007 test observations.

The test set is notoriously difficult. Using the training and test data for the 3s, 5s and 8s only, compared the multinomial logistic regression and the SVM (or the l2-penalized logistic regression) in terms of test error.
