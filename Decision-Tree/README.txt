Dataset: housetype.data was obtained from the original pool of 9409 questionnaires. The questionnaires with non-missing answers to the question “What is your type of home?” were selected. There are 9013 such questionnaires. The goal in this problem is to construct a classification tree to predict the type of home from the other demographics attributes. Refer to the documentation file “housetype.info.txt” for attributes names and order.

Used CART to construct an optimal decision tree. Plotted the optimal tree and interpret the results.
Handled the missing values and fit a multi-class classification tree using random forests. 
Identified the most important variables; commented on the dependence of the response on some most important variables.
