# Categorial-Data-Analysis
I am Ning (Cherie), a master's student with strong analytical background of statistics and finance seeking Data Analyst role with keen interests in data-driven insights and machine learning.

I have implemented machine learning techniques in categorical data analysis by R, Matlab, SAS and Python. For now I have just updated several projects. But I would continue to update my projects further as getting accustomed to Git.
